# EZSOCKS
Easy to use C Unix Socket wrapper library.

## Objectives
The existence of this project isn't to discourage further digging and self-learning on the C unix library, but to ease development and testing when one needed a quick way to use sockets. This is not meant to be a library, but a collection of source files that can be included into other projects for easy use.

### Dependencies
The library uses openssl for tls sockets.
